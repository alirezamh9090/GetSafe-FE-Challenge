# Getting Started with the project

If you want to check out the design insurance the address is `http://localhost:3000/buy/purchase=des_ins`, Here I created a generic flow and included all the step inside (which later can be optimized with lazy loading) just to make the app more flexible and also easier to change the order of the steps or add/remove one just by passing down appropriate date to the component. some parts seems more complex than it should be for the current use case, but I tried to make it more generic and flexible for future use cases.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
